= ActionMailer Callbacks

Version 1.0

== Installation

Drop "action_mailer_callbacks.rb" into either your "lib" directory.
Drop "action_mailer_callbacks_test.rb" into your "test/units" directory.

In the future, this will be made a proper plugin to make installation easier...

== What Is It?

ActionMailer callbacks provides basic callback support for ActionMailer.  It providers similar functionality to before and after filters available in ActionController.

== How Do I Use It?= 

There are 2 main ways to define a callback. In each case, the callback method is passed the mail as the only argument.

You may define a callback using a block:
class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  after_deliver do |mail|
    ...
  end
end

You may also define a callback using a symbol/string for a method name:
class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  before_deliver :append_advertisement

  def append_advertisement(mail)
    ...
  end
end

Callbacks take options which can be used to define which mail types (i.e. methods) they will be applied to.
These options take the format of *only* and *except*.
  - An *only* callback will only be run for methods which match the passed method names.
  - An *except* callback will be called for all methods EXCEPT those that match the passed method names
The options can take either an array of strings/symbols, or a single string/symbol.

class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  before_deliver :append_disclaimer, :only => [:email_friend, :announce_something]
  after_deliver :notify_user, :except => :invite_user

 ...
end

== Limitations

CURRENTLY, THE before_deliver CALLBACK DOES NOT HALT EXECUTION.  That may be added in the future, but in ther interim you will need to raise to halt.

== Anything Planned?

First, I would like to clean up the code a bit (extract most of the logic into a separate module, etc.).  I apologize for the messiness of the code, at the time I wrote it I just wanted something "that worked" and I was pressed for time.

In terms of features, I would like to do at least three more things with this:
1) Make it a proper plugin
2) Allow the before_deliver method to halt sending the email
3) Add an around_deliver callback which would allow around advice.

Feedback is welcomed.
