= ActionMailer Callbacks

Version 1.0

== Installation

Drop "action_mailer_callbacks.rb" into either your "lib" directory.
Drop "action_mailer_callbacks_test.rb" into your "test/units" directory.

In the future, this will be made a proper plugin to make installation easier...

== What Is It?

ActionMailer callbacks provides basic callback support for ActionMailer.  It providers similar functionality to before and after filters available in ActionController.

== How Do I Use It?= 

There are 2 main ways to define a callback. In each case, the callback method is passed the mail as the only argument.

You may define a callback using a block:
class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  after_deliver do |mail|
    ...
  end
end

You may also define a callback using a symbol/string for a method name:
class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  before_deliver :append_advertisement

  def append_advertisement(mail)
    ...
  end
end

Callbacks take options which can be used to define which mail types (i.e. methods) they will be applied to.
These options take the format of *only* and *except*.
  - An *only* callback will only be run for methods which match the passed method names.
  - An *except* callback will be called for all methods EXCEPT those that match the passed method names
The options can take either an array of strings/symbols, or a single string/symbol.

class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  before_deliver :append_disclaimer, :only => [:email_friend, :announce_something]
  after_deliver :notify_user, :except => :invite_user

 ...
end

== What About Halting the Chain?

You can halt the chain in either a before or after callback.  In order to do this, just call +halt_callback_chain+ in the block (or +self.class.halt_callback_chain+ in an instance method).
If the chain is halted in a before callback, the email will *NOT* be delivered and no other callbacks will be invoked (either any after callbacks or any remaining before callbacks).
If the chain is halted in an after callback, the email will have already been sent and all before callbacks would have run, but any remaining after callbacks will not be invoked.

class FooMailer < ActionMailer::Base
  before_deliver do |mail|
    halt_callback_chain if invalid_mail?(mail)
  end

  after_deliver :abort

  def abort(mail)
    self.class.halt_callback_chain
  end
end

== Anything Planned?

First, I would like to clean up the code a bit (extract most of the logic into a separate module, etc.).  I apologize for the messiness of the code, at the time I wrote it I just wanted something "that worked" and I was pressed for time.

In terms of features, I would like to do at least three more things with this:
1) Make it a proper plugin
2) Add an around_deliver callback which would allow around advice.
3) Add ability to skip filters
4) Add ability to prepend filters in the chain

Feedback is welcomed.
